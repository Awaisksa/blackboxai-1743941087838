# User Workspace

## Project Overview
`user-workspace` is a Node.js application that utilizes the Express framework to provide a lightweight, flexible backend for web applications. This repository serves as a starting point for developers to create and manage user workspaces within their applications. It may include features such as user authentication, workspace management, and potentially more, depending on the continued development.

## Installation
To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-workspace.git
   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
To start the application, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port configured in your application). You can then access it via a web browser or any REST client.

## Features
- Simple setup and configuration with Express framework.
- Future potential for user workspace creation and management.
- Easily extensible with appropriate middleware and libraries.

## Dependencies
This project includes a single dependency listed in the `package.json`:

- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.

For a complete list of sub-dependencies, refer to the `package-lock.json`.

## Project Structure
Here's a brief overview of the main files and directories in the project:

```
user-workspace/
├── index.js                # Main entry point of the application
├── package.json            # Contains project metadata and dependencies
└── package-lock.json       # Locks the versions of installed packages
```

### index.js
This is the main entry point where the Express server is initialized and configured.

### package.json
This file contains project details, dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

### package-lock.json
This file is automatically generated when you install node modules and locks down the versions of installed dependencies.
